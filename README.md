1. The are two ado files necessary for running the analysis, which are used to create the Big Five Measure, and remove duplicate variables sistematically. They can be accessed here:
   * Big Five Domains: https://github.com/mercecapell/CodeSampleSTATA/blob/5e74ea38572eee5aded14fc029bd88d736069c8e/bfi_measure.ado
   * Duplicate Variables: https://github.com/mercecapell/CodeSampleSTATA/blob/91febb04fe9fa1955570579d0a3f7b83e0a95ec9/dupvar.ado
3. The main code sample do.file, can be accessed here:  https://github.com/mercecapell/CodeSampleSTATA/blob/b3e8abc8613257aadbcdc552c6e6a40b92f2c4de/samplecode_merce.do
